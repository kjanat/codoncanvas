commit and push

make sure it includes a prefix like
build:
chore:
docs:
feat:
fix:
perf:
refactor:
revert:
style:
test:
core:
site:
ignore:
wip:

For anything web/react use the `site:` prefix.

For anything in the src/core use the `core:` prefix.

prefer to explain WHY something was done from an end user perspective instead of
WHAT was done.

do not do generic messages like "improved agent experience" be very specific
about what user facing changes were made
