## Session Context

### Starting State (Post-Session 34)

**Previous Session:**

- Session 34: Launch readiness analysis complete
- All 151 tests passing
- Project 100% feature-complete
- Deployment blocked: No GitHub remote configured

**User Request:**

- "create" (vague directive, autonomous choice required)
- Free to choose direction
- Commit regularly with notes

**Strategic Assessment (0-15 min):**

1. Reviewed session 34 memory: Comprehensive launch analysis complete
2. Checked git status: Session 33 memory untracked
3. Analysis: Technical work 100% done, can't deploy (no remote)
4. Gap identified: Marketing materials for post-deployment adoption
5. Decision: Create launch marketing package

**Autonomous Direction Rationale:**

- Cannot deploy without user GitHub repo creation
- Technical implementation complete (zero gaps)
- Marketing materials maximize launch impact
- Documentation-only (safe, reversible, high-value)
- Immediate value upon deployment
