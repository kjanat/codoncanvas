# CodonCanvas Assessment Framework

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Purpose:** Measure learning outcomes for CodonCanvas lesson sequence
**Target:** Secondary/tertiary biology students (ages 15+)

---

## Assessment Philosophy

CodonCanvas assessments focus on **conceptual understanding** over technical memorization. Students should demonstrate:

- **Pattern recognition**: Identifying mutation types from effects
- **Predictive reasoning**: Anticipating outcomes before testing
- **Systems thinking**: Connecting codon changes to visual changes
- **Transfer knowledge**: Applying concepts to biological scenarios

---

## Pre-Assessment (Before Lesson 1)

**Purpose:** Establish baseline understanding of genetic concepts
**Duration:** 10 minutes
**Format:** Written or digital quiz

### Pre-Assessment Questions

**1. DNA Structure (Knowledge)**
DNA is made of sequences of four bases. What are they?

- [ ] A, C, G, T
- [ ] A, B, C, D
- [ ] Red, Green, Blue, Yellow
- [ ] 0, 1, 2, 3

**2. Codons (Knowledge)**
A codon is:

- [ ] A single DNA base
- [ ] A sequence of three DNA bases
- [ ] A complete gene
- [ ] A type of protein

**3. Mutations (Comprehension)**
A mutation in DNA means:

- [ ] The DNA is broken
- [ ] The DNA sequence changes
- [ ] The organism dies
- [ ] DNA stops working

**4. Mutation Effects (Application)**
If a mutation changes one DNA base, which is most likely?

- [ ] No effect at all
- [ ] Small effect
- [ ] The organism dies immediately
- [ ] A new species forms

**5. Genetic Redundancy (Analysis)**
Multiple codons can code for the same amino acid. Why might this be useful?

- [ ] Makes DNA longer
- [ ] Protects against some mutations
- [ ] Makes proteins faster
- [ ] It's not useful, just random

**6. Reading Frames (Analysis)**
DNA is read in groups of three bases. If one base is deleted:

- [ ] Only that codon changes
- [ ] All codons downstream change
- [ ] Nothing changes
- [ ] The cell fixes it automatically

**7. Phenotype Connection (Synthesis)**
A "phenotype" is:

- [ ] The DNA sequence
- [ ] The observable traits
- [ ] A type of mutation
- [ ] The genetic code

**8. Mutation Types (Prior Knowledge)**
Have you heard of these mutation types? (Check all you know)

- [ ] Silent mutation
- [ ] Missense mutation
- [ ] Nonsense mutation
- [ ] Frameshift mutation
- [ ] None of these

**9. Programming Experience (Background)**
Have you written computer code before?

- [ ] Never
- [ ] Once or twice
- [ ] Several times
- [ ] Regularly

**10. Confidence (Metacognition)**
How confident are you explaining mutations to a friend?

- [ ] Slightly confident (2)
- [ ] Moderately confident (3)
- [ ] Very confident (4)
- [ ] Extremely confident (5)

## Formative Assessments (During Lessons)

### Lesson 1 Checkpoints

**Checkpoint 1A: Codon Recognition (Verbal/Hands-up)**
"If I change GGA to GGC, what will happen?"

- ✅ Correct: "Nothing changes" / "Same shape"
- ⚠️ Review needed: "Different shape" / "Unsure"

**Checkpoint 1B: Family Identification (Worksheet)**
Students complete Exercise 1.4 (testing CC* family)

- ✅ Mastery: Correctly identifies all 4 as same
- ⚠️ Review: Misses patterns or reports differences

**Checkpoint 1C: Creative Application (Observation)**
Students complete Exercise 1.6 (two shapes with TRANSLATE)

- ✅ Mastery: Working genome with two distinct shapes
- ⚠️ Support needed: Syntax errors, single shape, or missing TRANSLATE

---

### Lesson 2 Checkpoints

**Checkpoint 2A: Mutation Classification (Worksheet)**
Exercise 2.1 - identifying which mutations work

- ✅ Mastery: Correctly predicts functional vs non-functional
- ⚠️ Review: Random guessing or all marked as same

**Checkpoint 2B: Nonsense Recognition (Demonstration)**
Student can explain why early TAA stops execution

- ✅ Mastery: "It stops reading the rest of the code"
- ⚠️ Review: "It breaks the code" / Unsure

**Checkpoint 2C: Frameshift Understanding (Worksheet)**
Exercise 2.7 - comparing frameshift severity to missense

- ✅ Mastery: Recognizes frameshift affects multiple codons
- ⚠️ Review: Thinks they're equally severe

---

### Lesson 3 Checkpoints

**Checkpoint 3A: Transform Application (Observation)**
Student uses TRANSLATE, ROTATE, or SCALE correctly

- ⚠️ Support: Random transforms, no visible strategy

**Checkpoint 3B: Creative Synthesis (Portfolio)**
Exercise 3.5 composition meets requirements

- ✅ Mastery: 3+ shapes, 2+ transforms, visually intentional
- ⚠️ Support: Minimal composition or technical errors

**Checkpoint 3C: Evolution Reasoning (Reflection)**
Exercise 3.8 - explaining "fitness" in biological terms

- ✅ Mastery: Connects artistic choices to selection concepts
- ⚠️ Review: Purely aesthetic explanation, no biology link

---

## Post-Assessment (After Lesson 3)

**Purpose:** Measure learning gains and concept mastery
**Duration:** 15-20 minutes
**Format:** Written quiz + practical challenge

### Part A: Conceptual Understanding (10 questions)

**1. Codon Families (Knowledge)**
Which codons are in the CIRCLE family?

- [ ] GGA, GGC, GGG, GGT
- [ ] CCA, CCC, CCG, CCT
- [ ] AAA, AAC, AAG, AAT
- [ ] All starting with G

**2. Silent Mutations (Comprehension)**
A silent mutation is one that:

- [ ] Produces no change in output
- [ ] Only affects color
- [ ] Stops the program early
- [ ] Scrambles all downstream code

**3. Missense Mutations (Comprehension)**
A missense mutation:

- [ ] Changes nothing
- [ ] Changes one instruction to a different one
- [ ] Stops execution early
- [ ] Shifts the reading frame

**4. Nonsense Mutations (Application)**
Introducing a TAA codon in the middle of a genome will:

- [ ] Do nothing
- [ ] Change one shape
- [ ] Stop execution and truncate output
- [ ] Speed up the program

**5. Frameshift Mutations (Application)**
Deleting one base from a genome affects:

- [ ] Only that one codon
- [ ] That codon and the next one
- [ ] All codons downstream
- [ ] Nothing if you add it back

**6. Mutation Severity (Analysis)**
Rank these from least to most severe effect:
A) Silent B) Missense C) Nonsense D) Frameshift

Order: _____ → _____ → _____ → _____

**7. Reading Frames (Analysis)**
Why does reading frame matter?

- [ ] It determines color
- [ ] Triplets must be read correctly to decode instructions
- [ ] It speeds up execution
- [ ] It makes code more readable

**8. Biological Parallel (Synthesis)**
In real biology, which mutation type is most similar to changing GGA → GGC?

- [ ] Silent mutation (synonymous codon)
- [ ] Missense mutation (different amino acid)
- [ ] Nonsense mutation (stop codon)
- [ ] Frameshift mutation (insertion/deletion)

**9. Genetic Redundancy (Evaluation)**
The genetic code has redundancy (multiple codons → same amino acid). Is this:

- [ ] A design flaw (wasteful)
- [ ] Advantageous (error tolerance)
- [ ] Neutral (no effect)
- [ ] Depends on the organism

**10. Transfer Knowledge (Synthesis)**
Sickle cell disease is caused by a single base change (GAG → GTG) in the hemoglobin gene, changing glutamic acid to valine. This is:

- [ ] Silent mutation (no effect)
- [ ] Missense mutation (different amino acid)
- [ ] Nonsense mutation (stop codon)
- [ ] Frameshift mutation (reading frame shift)
