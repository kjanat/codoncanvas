# CodonCanvas Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** 2025-11-25

## Student Data Protection

CodonCanvas is designed with student privacy as a fundamental principle:

- **Local Storage Only:** All student work is stored exclusively in the browser's localStorage on the student's device
- **No Server Transmission:** Student code, genomes, and progress data are never transmitted to external servers
- **No Tracking:** No third-party analytics, tracking pixels, or behavioral monitoring by default
- **Device-Local:** All student work remains on the student's device until they explicitly choose to export or share

## Data Collection

### What We Collect

- **Learning Progress:** Achievement unlocks, genomes created, mutations applied (stored locally)
- **Code History:** Student-created genomes and their execution results (stored locally)
- **Session State:** Current workspace state for continuity across browser sessions (stored locally)

### What We DO NOT Collect

- Personal identifying information (names, emails, etc.)
- Student demographics or sensitive data
- Usage telemetry or behavioral analytics (unless explicitly opted-in for research)
- IP addresses or device fingerprints

## Data Retention

- Student data persists in browser localStorage until manually cleared
- No automatic expiration or deletion
- Students/teachers can clear all data via browser settings (Clear Site Data)
- No backup or cloud sync - data loss occurs if browser data is cleared

## Research Data (Opt-In Only)

Optional research metrics collection is available for educators participating in research studies:

- **Opt-In Required:** Research data collection is disabled by default
- **Aggregated Only:** Research data is anonymized and aggregated
- **Teacher Control:** Educators must explicitly enable research mode in teacher dashboard
- **Parental Consent:** Schools must obtain appropriate consent before enabling research data collection

## FERPA Compliance

CodonCanvas is designed to comply with FERPA (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act):

- **Educational Records:** Student work in CodonCanvas may constitute educational records under FERPA
- **School Responsibility:** Schools must obtain parental consent before classroom use if required by local policies
- **Data Security:** Local-only storage ensures student data remains under school/student control
- **Third-Party Access:** No third parties have access to student data (no server transmission)

## COPPA Compliance

For users under 13 (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act):

- **No Personal Information Collection:** CodonCanvas does not collect personal information from children
- **Parental Consent:** Schools must obtain verifiable parental consent for students under 13
- **No Behavioral Advertising:** No advertising or behavioral tracking of any kind

## Teacher/Educator Responsibilities

Educators using CodonCanvas in classroom settings must:

1. Review this privacy policy and ensure compliance with school policies
2. Obtain required parental consent before classroom use
3. Inform students that their work is stored locally on their device
4. Ensure students understand data persistence and deletion options
5. Disable research mode unless participating in approved research with proper consent

## Student Rights

Students and parents have the right to:

- Access all data stored by CodonCanvas (view in browser localStorage)
- Request deletion of all data (clear browser data for codoncanvas.dev)
- Opt out of any optional research data collection
- Export their work for personal records

## Data Security

- **Browser Security:** Data security relies on browser's localStorage security model
- **No Encryption:** Data is stored in plaintext in browser localStorage
- **Device Security:** Students should use secure, personal devices or school-managed devices
- **Public Computers:** Students should clear browser data after use on shared/public computers

## Changes to This Policy

- Material changes to this privacy policy will be posted prominently on codoncanvas.dev
- Continued use after policy changes constitutes acceptance

## Questions and Contact

- **Email:** [your-contact-email]
- **Response Time:** Within 48 hours (business days)
- **Data Requests:** Students/parents may request data access or deletion

## Research Inquiries

For educators interested in participating in research studies:

- Contact research team: [research-contact-email]
- IRB approval required for all research involving student data
- Separate consent forms and protocols apply

## Open Source Transparency

CodonCanvas is open source software:

- **Source Code:** Available at github.com/[your-repo]
- **Audit:** Code can be audited for privacy compliance
- **Community:** Privacy concerns can be reported via GitHub issues
